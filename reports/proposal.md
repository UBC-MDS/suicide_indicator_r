## User Persona & Research Questions

**User Persona**: Medical professionals such as psychiatrists, nurses, or doctors who want to understand how suicide rates have changed between countries over time. Our users typically have moderate data/computer literacy so this dashboard allows for them to explore and attempt to answer their own questions easily and efficiently.

**Example Use Case Research Questions (Primary tasks [bolded])**:
1. Brian is a doctor working in mental health and is considering moving to a different country. Brian wants to **[compare]** how his current countries suicide rate and attributes compares to the countries he is considering moving to.
2. Josee is a nursing student and wants to understand & **[visualize]** how suicide rates in her country and surrounding countries have changed over time.
3. Connie is a mental health researcher and wants to **[dissect]** the suicide dataset into her population of interest. By looking at countries comparisons by age, date range, region, sex, etc. she hopes to save time from doing the analysis herself and decide where to focus her effort.
