This report outlines the identified problem and proposed dashboard solution.

## Motivation & Purpose

According to [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/health-topics/suicide), suicides take away the lives of over 700,00 people globally every year, but many of these are preventable if there are sufficient support resources available. If we could understand the correlation between suicides among different cohorts and across the social economic spectrum, then we may be able to target the appropriate resources to a specific demographic of population. To address this challenge, we propose building a data visualization app that allows doctors and mental health researchers to visually explore a dataset of suicides in countries around the world. Our app will show various socio-economic measurements and allow users to explore the data by filtering and re-ordering on different variables to order to compare socio-economic factors that may affect suicide rates.

## User Persona & Research Questions

**User Persona**: Medical professionals such as psychiatrists, nurses, or doctors who want to understand how suicide rates have changed between countries over time. Our users typically have moderate data/computer literacy so this dashboard allows for them to explore and attempt to answer their own questions easily and efficiently.

**Example Use Case Research Questions (Primary tasks [bolded])**:
1. Brian is a doctor working in mental health and is considering moving to a different country. Brian wants to **[compare]** how his current countries suicide rate and attributes compares to the countries he is considering moving to.
2. Josee is a nursing student and wants to understand & **[visualize]** how suicide rates in her country and surrounding countries have changed over time.
3. Connie is a mental health researcher and wants to **[dissect]** the suicide dataset into her population of interest. By looking at countries comparisons by age, date range, region, sex, etc. she hopes to save time from doing the analysis herself and decide where to focus her effort.
